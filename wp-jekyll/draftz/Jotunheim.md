<div class="wp-container-29 wp-block-columns has-2-columns"><div class="wp-container-27 wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-dgwt-justified-gallery"><div class="gallery galleryid-4368 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-17"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Jotunheimvegen](https://www.van42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMGP3388-2-150x150.jpg)](https://www.van42.com/imgp3388-2/) </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-17-2247"> In esplorazione lungo la Jotunheimvegen / Exploring along the Jotunheimvegen </figcaption></figure> </div></div>After the heavy rain of [last night](https://www.van42.com/en/?p=4349&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=2050), we wake up on the wooded hills that climb west of Lillehammer, in the spot identified near a small lake, now flooded with light. The temperature is cool but the sun is already warming the air, allowing us to prepare breakfast outside. We take a walk along the lake and then take a path that leads to the nearby pastures, judging by the bleating of various shades that we hear.

## Lillehammer

We set off and head towards **[Lillehammer](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/eastern-norway/the-lillehammer-region/)**, for a reconnaissance stop at the local tourist information center. In fact, since on [the first day](https://www.van42.com/en/?p=4340&preview=true&_thumbnail_id=1990), due to the unstable weather, we decided to change the travel itinerary originally planned, we are now navigating on sight. The town of Lillehammer is known for having hosted the [Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Winter_Olympics) in 1994: the two ski jumping trampolines, recognizable even from a distance, testify to this. We stop at the [visitors center](https://en.lillehammer.com/?_ga=2.220187929.1600739022.1563625152-1046737073.1563625152), located at the city railway station; being at the gates of the Jotunheimen National Park, we hope to be able to gather some information on possible excursions to undertake.

We are given some general indications on the weather, fair but not exceptional, and on where to stay overnight. We fill up with fuel at a Circle K petrol station and have a coffee at the nearby McDonald’s where we take advantage of the free Wi-Fi connection and the electricity available to define the itinerary to go through today, also in view of the possible trekking.

## Peer Gynt Vegen

We then leave for the **[Jotunheimen National Park](https://jotunheimen.com/en/)**, literally the “home of the giants”, a national park of 1151 sq km with peaks over 2300 m, narrow valleys and deep lakes. The park is located north-west of Lillehammer and, to reach it, we mean by running a series of roads marked by the [Lonely Planet guide](https://shop.lonelyplanet.com/products/norway) as particularly scenic. The first of these is the **[Peer Gynt Vegen](http://www.peergyntvegen.no/)** which winds its way for 57 km from Skei to [Espedalen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espedalen), following the route traveled by [Peer Gynt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Gynt), the legendary character created by [Henrik Ibsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen).

<div class="wp-block-dgwt-justified-gallery"><div class="gallery galleryid-4368 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-19"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Peer Gynt Vegen](https://www.van42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190702_150554-150x150.jpg)](https://www.van42.com/img_20190702_150554/) </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-19-2234"> Punto di accesso alla Peer Gynt Vegen dove il pedaggio si paga con carta di credito: il sistema è completamente automatizzato / Entrance to Peer Gynt Vegen where you have to pay toll by credit card: the system is fully automated </figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Peer Gynt Vegen](https://www.van42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/peer-gynt-vegen_a-150x150.jpg)](https://www.van42.com/peer-gynt-vegen_a/) </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-19-2304"> Cartina raffigurante l'itinerario della Peer Gynt Vegen (tratta da http://www.jannekeswereld.nl/2015/06/13/peer-gynt-vegen-bergweg-noorwegen/) / Map of the Peer Gynt Vegen itinerary (from http://www.jannekeswereld.nl/2015/06/13/peer-gynt-vegen-bergweg-noorwegen/) </figcaption></figure> </div></div>We know that there is a toll to pay but it is not yet clear how we will pay as, to access Peer Gynt Vegen, we are climbing up the mountains, far from civilization. Moreover, trying to set the road as an itinerary in the [Google Maps navigator](https://www.google.com/maps), the software tries to direct us to other routes and the street view does not cover it. Along the road, however, we find signs that indicate “Peer Gynt Vegen”, as we get closer to it: shortly after the access, the toll booth with automatic barrier appears in front of us. The system is fully mechanized and accepts credit cards. We pay and start the journey. The landscape is wild and green with a prevalence of shrubs. We meet rare machines. We stop for lunch at a picnic table next to a bucolic stream: what a peace! We resume the dirt path and proceed to the end of the itinerary.

From here we are also intent on taking the **[Jotunheimvegen](https://jotunheimvegen.no/)**, a 45 km long road that branches off from [Skåbu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sk%C3%A5bu) to [Bygdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bygdin), leading us to the gates of the national park. However, the itinerary does not appear on the road map and is not even recognized by the Google Maps navigator; we still manage to access it by returning to the E6 and heading to Skåbu.

<div class="wp-block-dgwt-justified-gallery"><div class="gallery galleryid-4368 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-21"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Skåbu](https://www.van42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190702_180006-150x150.jpg)](https://www.van42.com/img_20190702_180006/) </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-21-2236"> Cartello informativo a Skåbu recante indicazioni sugli itinerari percorribili nella zona / Information sign in Skåbu with directions on routes to take in the area </figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon portrait"> [![Jotunheimvegen](https://www.van42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190702_181031-150x150.jpg)](https://www.van42.com/img_20190702_181031/) </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-21-2238"> Indicazione relativa all'accesso alla Jotunheimvegen / Information at the Jotunheimvegen beginning </figcaption></figure> </div></div>The Jotunheimvegen crosses from east to west an area characterized by large green spaces, offering beautiful views with shrub vegetation and stretches of water. Halfway through the route it begins to drizzle and soon the rain turns to sleet. We take the road that runs along the [Vinstre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinstre) lake, dotted with numerous red houses on the northern shore, and we enter the Fv51.

The stretch of the latter that goes from Garli to Hindsæter, or the **[Valdresflye](https://www.nasjonaleturistveger.no/en/routes/valdresflye)**, is considered [national scenic route](https://www.nasjonaleturistveger.no/en/routes) and crosses a beautiful valley offering various vantage points. We stop at the [Rjupa](https://www.nasjonaleturistveger.no/en/routes/valdresflye?attraction=Rjupa) viewpoint which offers a broad view of Lake Vinstre and the mountainous landscape that frames the valley. We resume our itinerary along the Fv51 towards the north. Unfortunately the sky is gray and sometimes it rains / snows. We notice a herd of reindeer moving in a group not far from the road: seeing that they have caught our attention, some of them stop to look at us in turn.

Going on, on the left we find the [Gjende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjende) and, behind it, the **[Besseggen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPxlB2YwLH4)** ridge, on which the much appreciated homonymous trekking passes. We decide to make a quick survey of the logistics of the excursion by taking the road that leads to the [Gjendesheim lodge](https://gjendesheim.dnt.no/en/), where a [ferry](https://www.gjende.no/en/) leaves for [Memurubu lodge](https://www.memurubu.no/en/home/), the starting point of the trek. The wind is blowing hard and the temperature has dropped significantly compared to this morning. In the car park at the lodge you cannot leave your car for more than two hours and it is indicated to use, instead, the [Reinsvangen long term parking](https://www.besseggen1743.no/en/parking-and-buses), located at the beginning of the road, from which you can take a free shuttle to the ferry pier . We enter the lodge, which also serves as a bar and restaurant, and we are greeted by an inviting smell of toast and fried butter: we go out before being tempted!

After the reconnaissance we move to the nearby [camping di Maurvangen](https://www.maurvangen.no/), the only one in the area. We take a simple pitch without electricity and two tokens for the shower but it is so cold that we decide to postpone it until the next morning. We take advantage of the common kitchen, which smells a little closed, and of the cookware made available by the campsite. After dinner, holed up in the van, we collapse directly in bed.
