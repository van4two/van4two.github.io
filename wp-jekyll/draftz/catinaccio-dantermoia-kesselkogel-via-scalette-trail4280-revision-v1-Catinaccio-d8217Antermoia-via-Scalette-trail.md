<div class="wp-container-5574 wp-block-columns has-2-columns"><div class="wp-container-5572 wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-dgwt-justified-gallery"></div>Lake Antermoia, a jewel set in the Catinaccio group, a long-dreamed and desired destination. Having included it among the projects in the drawer for some years, we decide to take advantage of one of the summer weekends to begin exploring this part of the Dolomites that we still know little about, the Val di Fassa. Browsing the web, some time ago we found an interesting itinerary on the Volpi del Vajolet blog, scheduled at the time but postponed due to very bad weather. Continuing the search, on the Facebook group Val di Fassa Trekking we find various ideas, discovering that the lake can be reached by following different itineraries as well as the classic Val di Vajolet, including Val Duron, Val di Dona and Val Udai. Being already in the middle of July and knowing the fame of Antermoia, we aim for an excursion that allows us, as far as possible, to avoid the crowds. We therefore reconsider the initial itinerary opting, in the end, to follow it in the opposite direction, or counterclockwise, as indicated on Sentres.com and on the Gardeccia refuge website.

The circular route starts from the Gardeccia refuge, reachable from Ciampedie along the CAI 540 path, and follows the 583 path to the Antermoia refuge and then continues on the 584 to the Vajolet refuge and, from here, on the 546 to return to Gardeccia. The part of the path 583 called “path of the Scalette” has a couple of sections equipped with an iron cable.

## Towards Gardeccia

After a night spent in a van in a clearing surrounded by the woods just outside Vigo di Fassa, we go down early in the village, where we take the cable car to Ciampedie (first ride at 8) which we reach in a few minutes. From here our itinerary begins: we take the easy path 540 which, crossing the forest and some meadows that in winter turn into ski slopes, in about 40 ‘takes us to the Gardeccia refuge (1949 m).

## Scalette trail

Fill the flasks at the fresh fountain at the crossroads in front of the refuge, we proceed along path 583 which quickly leads us under the Larsech group. Flanking the southern side, we gradually gain altitude until we take the path of the Scalette which winds its way between the Gran Cront and the Pala de La Lacia.

After two short sections equipped with a metal cable and some rungs driven into the rock, we continue to climb, until we reach the Passo delle Scalette (2348 m).

From here we cross a first verdant plateau dotted with yellow flowers, and then cross the wide valley of Laussa (or Lausa), crossing some roe deer just before the Forcella dei Camosci (2648 m), so called because of the ease with which they meet. wild animals in this wild and uncrowded area.

## Lake Antermoia

The lake of Antermoia lives definitely up to its fame. Flanked by the Croda del Lago on the northern shore, its crystal clear waters take on gorgeous shades of blues and greens as soon as the sun peaks out of the clouds. We make a 15min stop at the edge of the lake for a quick snack and for the first real break from the beginning of the journey.

At the end of the flat part of the valley, strewn with debris probably transported by the melting of snow and ice that form in winter, you face the steep climb to be tackled to gain the Antermoia pass, the narrow pass that separates this valley from the Vajolet valley. The progression is slowed down by the presence of snow, however it can be tackled even without crampons (which in any case would have helped!). Once you reach the saddle, the view sweeps all around.

## Vajolet valley

Through a steep and not easy descent, however without snow, we reach the Passo Principe refuge where, attracted by the scent of rosemary potatoes, we indulge in a quick meal.

Before risking to relax too much, let’s get back on track: now it’s all downhill! We quickly descend to the Vajolet and Preuss refuges, another interesting crossroads: from here in fact starts the itinerary 542 for the Re Alberto Refuge and the Vajolet Towers, which from afar overlook the valley. Finally, along the comfortable and very popular path 546, we return to Gardeccia and, continuing, to Ciampedie where, with the cable car (last ride at 18:30) we return to Vigo.

> **Tips**  
> It is advisable to follow the itinerary anticlockwise so as to take the path of the Scalette uphill, still rested and in the morning, when the probability of bad weather is generally less, reserving the more comfortable descent on the less demanding path from the Passo Principe refuge for the return in the afternoonSi consiglia di contattare i rifugi della zona (noi abbiamo telefonato al Gardeccia) per verificare le condizioni del percorso e l’eventuale presenza di neve
