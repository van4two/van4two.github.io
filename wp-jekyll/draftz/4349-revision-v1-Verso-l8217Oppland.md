Little by little the sun comes out, at this time already high but covered by some clouds. Since the temperature is pleasant, we open the folding table and set up breakfast outside, while in the campers next to us we still sleep.

## Jettegrytene

We leave for **[Jettegrytene](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/potholes/9970/)**, a series of water holes, pools and slides carved into the rock by the flow of a stream in an area not far from where we are now. A 2016 [youtube post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmCzANPiCSc&t=53s) defines them as an amenity known only to locals. Only three years later, in reality, even summary information on the pools can be found on the dedicated page on [visitnorway.com](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/potholes/9970/) and on [that](https://www.visittelemark.com/things-to-do/potholes-p544563) of the Telemark region. Furthermore, reading the [Tripadvisor forum](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2419721-d4598375-Reviews-Jettegrytene_i_Nissedal-Nissedal_Municipality_Telemark_Eastern_Norway.html), e learn that the road to reach the pools has recently been closed for an unspecified period. Since we are now here we decide to go exploring anyway.

Um, there’s a closing smell here. At the end of the asphalted road, where the last stretch of dirt road begins, in fact, we find a construction site in place. We ask a worker for information that the road is closed for construction but it is still possible to continue on foot. We park and find ourselves in front of a metal gate that does not allow the passage of either vehicles or pedestrians. From the direction we are going, a man arrives in a car who gets out to open the gate to get out; having read that the pools are located on private land, we ask him, in English, if it is allowed to access on foot, obtaining a negative answer: the pools are currently not open to visitors and not even visible due to the too much water present in this period, which covers them completely.

We walk along the west bank of the vast body of water (the one opposite Treungen); here we find a series of small sandy beaches, alternating with rocks worked by the water. What peace! Unfortunately the sky clouds over quickly and it starts to rain. At this point, also considering the unfavorable weather conditions, we get back in the car and leave directly for Oslo.

## I pedaggi stradali

We travel along a series of secondary roads until we reach the E18. We are not sure if the stretch closest to the capital is paid, because we see signs bearing the words “toll” combined with cameras, but never actual toll booths. We read on the **[Euro Parking Collection web site](https://www.epcplc.com/)** (EPC) that the cameras record the license plate of the vehicle and, in the weeks / months following the transit, the toll bill relating to the roads traveled is sent home. It is advisable to register your vehicle on the website with the specifications such as to allow the correct charge based on the type of means of transport and the relative Euro classification as, in the absence of a duly documented declaration, the bill is made in excess. One of the parameters used to calculate tolls is just how polluting the vehicle is. We proceed to the laborious registration “in fits and starts”, since the data connection of our mobile phones is not always excellent.

## Oslo

Wanting to dedicate our trip mainly to nature, we decide to give ourselves just a quick “taste” of **[Oslo](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/eastern-norway/oslo/)**; the idea is to concentrate on the waterfront, where there are numerous places of interest in the capital. We aim for a [parking lot](https://onepark.no/) close to the [station](https://www.banenor.no/Jernbanen/Stasjonssok/-O-/Oslo-S/), near the [Bjørvika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rvika) district; this is one of the most central areas of the city, with development mainly on the sea, but the traffic, near our destination, proceeds very slowly.

<div class="wp-block-dgwt-justified-gallery"><div class="gallery galleryid-4358 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-10659"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Il teatro dell'opera di Oslo](https://www.van42.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMGP3280-2-150x150.jpg)](https://www.van42.com/imgp3280-2/) </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-10659-2051"> L'accesso principale al teatro avviene dal livello inferiore / The main access to the theater is from the lower level </figcaption></figure> </div></div>Once we reach the parking lot and leave the van, we begin to explore this part of the city on foot, once a port freight yard and, since 2000, the subject of an urban redevelopment and regeneration program that proposes it as the new cultural center of Oslo. Through a series of interventions that aims to end in 2020, the intention of the city administration is, in fact, to transform the capital into a cultural center of international level. We then head towards the waterfront and immediately recognize, in the distance, the **[Opera house](https://operaen.no/en/)**, monument symbol of modern Oslo and fulcrum of the aforementioned redevelopment program. Designed by the [Snøhetta](https://snohetta.com/) architectural firm, the building resembles an iceberg and invites you to explore it from the most disparate angles (you can also climb to the roof which merges with the access ramp itself).

We proceed with a walk on the seafront, then return to the car and get back on the bike towards the north.

We take the E6, a rather busy road full of works in progress that crosses the [Oppland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppland) in a south-north direction to the regions of [Romsdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romsdal) e [Trøndelag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%c3%b8ndelag), on the Norwegian Sea. We stop at [**Hamar**](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/eastern-norway/the-hamar-region/) where we visit the remains of the medieval **[Domkirkeodden](https://domkirkeodden.no/en)** church, the “glass cathedral”, that is the ruins of the main city cult building enclosed in a protective glass structure. The Romanesque church, completed around 1200, was later enlarged in the Gothic style and, after having been for three centuries one of the most important liturgical sites from Oslo to Trondheim, caught fire during the Nordic Seven Years War (1563-70) and, from that moment, it was left to ruin.

Here we climb the Saksumdalsvegen, a road that winds above the village, stopping for the night in a spot next to the small Tjernshaugtjenet lake. Unfortunately, there are already two vans occupying the best positions near the pond. We position ourselves in a clearing a little further away, cook while it’s raining outside and soon go to bed.
