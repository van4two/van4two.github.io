Our plan is to cross the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark to reach [Hirtshals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirtshals) before night on the From Hirtshlas, on the northern tip of Denmark, we will reach [Kristiansand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristiansand), located on the southern coast of Norway, after a 2h30 ferry passage.   
Morning traffic is very flowing and allows us to be in [Bremen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen) by lunch time. After a couple of stops, here and near [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg), we enter Denmark. We cross a verdant but rather repetitive barren landscape until we finally reach Hirtshals, from where the [Fjordline](https://www.fjordline.com/en) ferry at 11:30 pm will take us to Norway. We leave the port almost an hour late and land in **Kristiansand** at around 3 am; the sky is clear and the air is fresh and pleasant. From the port, after a 5min drive, we reach the Baneheia lakes, where we have previously spotted ([park4night](https://park4night.com/lieu/58798//kristiansand-10-svarttj%C3%B8nnveien/norway/kristiansand#prettyPhoto)) a quiet and safe parking lot to stop. We spend the night here, next to other campers that, like us, are arriving or are waiting for a departing ferry.

## Baneheia

We wake up late in the morning to find out that the campers and vans parked last night have been replaced by numerous cars and the trail leading to the lake is bustling with people running around with all sorts of beach gear from inflatable mattresses to portable BBQs. At the edge of the parking a post sign provides information about **[Baneheia](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/southern-norway/kristiansand/listings-kristiansand/baneheia-outdoor-area/86362/)** a series of small lakes surrounded by a pathways network that can be covered on foot. We take the necessary for breakfast, the bathing suits and we set off to explore the park. The water does not seem particularly cold: many people are already in for a swim. We dive too, it’s so cool! We take a good swim to the opposite side of the lake, rest for a few minutes on a floating wooden platform and return to our corner on the rocks. Marvelous!

The southern part of Norway, in fact, at this time of the year frequently enjoys a sunny and pleasant climate </figcaption></figure> </div></div>## Schedule change

We chill in the sun and start studying the travel plan we set up before the trip. During yesterday’s long Holland-Norway crossing, we carefully looked at the weather forecast for the coming few days. Unfortunately we have noticed that, in the area of the fjords, our main destination, generalized bad weather is indicated for at least a week. After considering several options, let’s review the travel program, trying to follow the route initially hypothesized, in the opposite direction. In this way we plan to reach the fjords only in a few days, hoping, in the meantime, for an improvement in the weather conditions. We will then leave the coast and head inland, travelling in a northerly direction; the intention is to intercept the coast on the Norwegian Sea near [Kristiansund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristiansund)–[Trondehim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim), and then begin to cross the fjords going south.

Back to the van, we then set off heading north along the Rv41, away from the coast, towards [**Telemark**](https://www.visittelemark.com/) county: the idea is to reach **[Jettegrytene](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/potholes/9970/)**, a series of pools carved into the rock by the water of a river, located in a place described as very suggestive. We proceed along the Rv41 stopping at the small town of [Åmli](https://www.amli.kommune.no/politikk-og-organisasjon/welcome-to-amli/) to collect some Norwegian kroner, as it seems that there is a toll to pay to access the site of the pools and it is not clear how the payment is made. The small town seems semi-deserted and we cannot find the bank marked at the entrance to the town. We continue to the intersection of Rv41 with Fv352, at the [Haugsjåsund campsite](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/haugsj%C3%A5sund-familiecamping/7291/). Here illustrative panels indicate the Jettegrytene 16 km further on, recalling the 50 crowns necessary for access. It is already past 20 and the campsite reception is closed. Finally, we find an ATM in Treungen, a pretty and tiny village on the shore of Lake [Nisser](https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/canoe-cayak-on-lake-nisser-(vr%C3%A5dal)/11380/). We stop for the night in a [free parking area](https://park4night.com/lieu/64873/#.XccD9jNKiUk) with spotless public toilets already occupied by some campers, going to bed with the sun still high.
