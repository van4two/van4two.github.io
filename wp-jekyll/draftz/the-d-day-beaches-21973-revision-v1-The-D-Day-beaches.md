<div class="wp-container-3936 wp-block-columns has-2-columns"><div class="wp-container-3934 wp-block-column">We wake up on a beautiful sunny day in the parking lot in front of the [Plage du Butin](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Plage+du+Butin/@49.4266669,0.2200179,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7a6a21118e9ec7c2?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifh8m24o3WAhWXHsAKHQ-sBykQ_BIIiwEwDg). We spend the morning visiting **Honfleur**, a delightful Calvados town, located on the mouth of the Seine. We take a walk down to the quaint harbor, continuing along the narrow and graceful streets of the Old Town. We note many art studios and venues where to enjoy crêpes and other local specialties. I look down at the ten-century [Lieutenance](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenance_d%27Honfleur) building located at the entrance of the harbor, the former seat of the town administration and the ancient gate of the town, now being restored.

Along the road, we stop at [Le Fournil de Bénerville](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Le+Fournil+de+B%C3%A9nerville/@49.3487814,0.0503798,18.69z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e1d4dc42a634d3:0xcb578c5adcf243ce!8m2!3d49.3487803!4d0.0510595), a pretty boulangerie-cake shop that attracts our attention by the way the tables and the outdoor benches are built with white painted pallets. As we have seen two years ago on the [trip to Provence](http://www.van42.org/wp-admin/www.van42.org/old/2015/08/07/provence/), we note that most people, even young people, do not speak a single word of English. They often understand it but answer exclusively in French.

Continuing on our itinerary, down the D27 we are attracted by a bucolic corner in the countryside: a tree-lined shore on a stream with grazing cows on the opposite side. We feel the urge for a regenerating stop, bathe in fresh and transparent water and clinging to the sun.

We resume with a vigorous coffee – the van is equipped with a mini-moca – and let’s go, now close to the area we intend to explore today. The crossing of the **[Pegasus Bridge](https://musee.memorial-pegasus.com/en/pegasus-bridge/)**, just before the village of Bénouville, bring us back to more than half a century ago. The grip of this retractable bridge, built by Gustave Eiffel in 1871, allowed the crossing of allied troops coming from the sea. In 1994, the original bridge was replaced by a wider and more modern version (the original is exposed in the [Mémorial Pegasus park](https://musee.memorial-pegasus.com/en/)).

From here in 40 minutes we arrive at **[Arromanches-les Bains](http://it.normandie-tourisme.fr/la-normandia-si-presenta/citta-e-villaggi-della-normandia/altri-luoghi-importanti/arromanches-564-6.html)**. From the plateau overlooking the coast are visible concrete blocks in the water, not far from the beach, what remains of the artificial harbor built during the World War II. The bright colors of the sea and the beach, which today seems a quiet and pleasant place, contrast with the idea of the events that took place here. Before leaving, in the intent to visit the D-Day beaches with greater awareness, we watched the *[Normandy Surviving D-Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGz9j-HbieU)* documentary and the Steven Spielberg [*Saving Private Ryan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan) movie, which resumes the events that happened on these beaches.

Curious from the start of the holiday of tasting the cider, fermented apple juice characteristic of Normandy, we follow the signs and shortly we find ourselves in the garden of a local producer who welcomes us into his “shop” by tasting the three different types of cider he produces: dry, semi-dry and sweet. The flavor initially reminds us of beer but with a remarkably fruity note. We buy a box of six mixed cider bottles (€ 16.30).

We are impressed by the vastness of the cemetery-memorial, made up of a gloomy and well-groomed meadow, dotted with innumerable white crosses, seemingly equal to each other. We approach and begin to read the names carved on each of them, state of origin, date of birth, and death. In front of some of them, there are sporadic flowers, roses or small American flags. From the cemetery is visible [**Omaha Beach**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach), another site on which landings took place.

The plan is to go to the area so that we can move on the next morning directly to visit the fortified island. We stop for the night at the motorhome area reported by [Furgoperfecto](https://www.furgovw.org/index.php?topic=219643.msg4273838#msg4273838), [La Bidonnière](https://www.labidonniere.fr/). The small hill village, fortress, and church are already visible in the distance to the horizon.
