<div class="wp-container-104 wp-block-columns has-2-columns"><div class="wp-container-102 wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image">![](www.van42.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GoogleDrive_2017.05.20-13.-cote-alabatre-1024x625.jpg)<figcaption>Beach delimited by high alabaster cliffs near Veules-les-Roses </figcaption></figure>In order to make full use of the four days available, we leave from Den Haag on Friday evening. The plan is to drive a long way down the road that separates us from Normandy so we will begin to explore the region the next morning. We head to Antwerp and Brussels (A4, then E19, E17), finding some intense traffic near Rotterdam. Just past the French border begins the highway (A1) of which we travel a short stretch before stopping for the night in Curlu, a tiny little village in Picardy, where we have previously found a quiet and safe place to stay, map out on [Furgoperfecto](https://www.furgovw.org/index.php?topic=286213.msg3422172#msg3422172).

We arrive just after 11 pm and the atmosphere is pleasant and at this time the roads are deserted. The parking lot where we spend the night is in a clean area, in front of the illuminated village church.

We move to the countryside surrounding the village for a quiet breakfast, beginning to plan the day, warmed by a lukewarm sun.

We head towards the coast and in two hours and a half, we arrive in **Veules-les-Roses**, a pretty village built along the shortest river of France (1100 m overall length). We walk the waterway to the sea, meeting those who once were mills and small locks. At the mouth of the river Veules we find an immense pebble beach and here are the first white cliffs of the **Côte d’Albâtre**. The coastline so named goes from Le Tréport, just northeast of where we are, and ends before Le Havre. From the wharfs that stand out on the dry beach, we realize that we are at a low [tide](http://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Veules-Les-Roses/tides/latest). The range – that is the difference between high and low tide – in this area can be as high as ten meters. Returning to our steps we cross the village again, crossing the road on the other side of the river where we buy crispy baguettes at the [boulangerie patisserie Loue](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Boulangerie+Patisserie+Loue/@49.8742019,0.7980872,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xffb483559bc86e3c?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJsJfIxNvVAhXNZ1AKHZEcDgwQ_BIIdjAK).

We continue and, just before the port town of Fécamp, we follow the signs to **Cap Fagnet**, a belvedere overlooking the town with ample views of the steep white cliffs. Here are some reinforced concrete constructions, German outposts dating back to World War II. They are just the first of many that we will see the [next day, dedicated to the D-Day beaches](http://www.van42.org/en/2013/05/21/the-d-day-beaches/).

We park in the village, near the station, and walk to the **Falaise d’Amont** – accessible on foot, by shuttle train or by car – which offers spectacular views. This first high point is north of Étretat while south of the village is visible the Falaise d’Aval, our next destination. We descend from the Falaise d’Amont along the path leading to the beach and walking along the waterfront. The beach is in pebbles that some banners forbid to collect and take away; somebody dares to take a swim.

We arrive at the foothills of the **Falaise d’Aval** above a characteristic rock formation similar to an elephant trunk. Not far from the coast, there is another notable formation shaped as a pinnacle, made famous by Maurice Leblanc as a legendary hiding place of the treasures stolen by [Arsène Lupin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin) (in the novel the pinnacle is hollow). The climb to this second promontory is also worth more than the first, offering good views of the coast, the pinnacle and the trunk.

With a bit of regret we skip the planned stop in [Le Havre](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1181), a UNESCO site known for the reinforced concrete architecture dating to the post-war reconstruction. The road passes to the **[Pont de Normandie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_de_Normandie)** (toll 5.4 €) that with its 850 m span is the widest bridge in Europe.

On our arrival in Honfleur, we find out that the two campgrounds are already closed, probably because we are in low season. We decide to spend the night in the free parking lot of the [Plage du Butin](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Plage+du+Butin/@49.4251503,0.2148617,16z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x47e033a5e30f5dc5:0x40c14484fbceaf0!2sHonfleur,+France!3b1!8m2!3d49.418762!4d0.233262!3m4!1s0x0:0x7a6a21118e9ec7c2!8m2!3d49.4266698!4d0.2200162), where we have dinner with crispy baguettes and a selection of local cheese.
